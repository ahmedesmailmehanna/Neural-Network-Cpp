# AI Escape Sandbox

## Overview
AI Escape Sandbox is an **AI-driven sandbox game** where intelligent agents learn and adapt to navigate, survive, and escape dynamic environments. The project leverages **Unity ML-Agents** to develop emergent AI behaviors, making each playthrough unique.

## Features
- **AI-Driven Gameplay**: The game revolves around autonomous agents using **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to make decisions.
- **Physics-Based Interactions**: The world is fully interactive, allowing AI to manipulate objects and terrain.
- **Procedural Challenges**: Randomized environments ensure that AI must continuously learn and adapt.
- **ML-Agents Integration**: Uses **Unity ML-Agents Toolkit** for training AI agents.
- **Multi-Agent System**: Supports AI competing, collaborating, or evolving in an open-world setting.

## Technologies Used
- **Unity (C#)** â€“ Core game development
- **Unity ML-Agents** â€“ Reinforcement learning framework
- **Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch)** â€“ AI model training
- **Neural Networks & Reinforcement Learning** â€“ Agent decision-making
- **Physics Engine** â€“ Object interactions & environmental dynamics

## How It Works
1. **Agent Setup**: AI agents are initialized with sensors, reward functions, and decision models.
2. **Environment Interaction**: Agents explore, interact, and attempt to achieve escape objectives.
3. **Training & Learning**:
   - Uses **reinforcement learning (RL)** to improve behavior over time.
   - Training happens through episodes where agents receive rewards for progress.
4. **Emergent Behavior**: Over multiple training iterations, agents develop unique escape strategies.
